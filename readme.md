Connect4
Connect4 is a game where two players take turns placing a token on columns that drop to the bottom. When a player forms 4 of his tokens in a line - horizontally, vertically,or diagonally - the player wins.

Visualization

Create a class that represents the connect 4 game with an interface that allows interacting with the model. The model should include winner detection.

Tip: We do not need to handle user input - only calling the objects and printing to the termina/console is fine.
